    "# Week 6: Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "As a budding data scientist, you have learned many of the foundational components of programming, including syntax, operators, conditional statements, and iterative statements. In this module you will learn about one of the last fundamental components of Python: collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections are a data type that many programming languages implement. The purpose of a collection is to house multiple values in a single variable. In Python, the term *sequence* is preferred when referring to these types of objects, rather than the term collection. However, to maintain consistency with other programming languages, we will refer to them as collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, like many other programming languages, provides several different types of collections. Some of those include:\n",
    "* Arrays\n",
    "* Lists\n",
    "* Dictionaries (i.e., key-value pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our discussion of collections, we will focus on arrays. While we will not use arrays in this course, having an understanding of arrays is vital to understanding the other types of collections we will use. Arrays are a special type of object in programming. They are containers, or collections, for storing assorted data. The data must be the same type. Arrays behave like a storage bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><center><img src = \"assets/m&m_sorted.jpg\" width = \"500\"></center></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture above, several jars contain different colored M&Ms. While the jars contain different colors of the candy, they are the same type of candy. Arrays can store multiple variables (which all have different values), so long as they are the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "While arrays may appear similar to variables, they are distinct. Often, arrays tend to be difficult for programming novices to grasp. Some of the confusion stems from conflating the syntax and function of arrays with those of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, declaring a variable follows this simple pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`name`* = `value`\n",
    "\n",
    "You may end up with many different variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`name_one`* = `value one`\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`name_two`* = `value two`\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`name_three`* = `value three`\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`name_four`* = `value four`\n",
    "\n",
    "This may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "int_a = 3\n",
    "int_b = 6\n",
    "int_c = 33\n",
    "int_d = 96\n",
    "int_e = 123\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking these variables may become tedious or cumbersome. A simpler approach is to use an array to store all of these variables into a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an array, a similar pattern for creating a variable is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`name`* = array('*`type`*', [`value 1`, `value 2`,...,`value n`])\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the similarities between creating a variable and an array:\n",
    "* Both are given a name.\n",
    "* Each has a value assigned (arrays have one or more values assigned).\n",
    "\n",
    "An array requires you to specify the data type *`type`*, which is not very Pythonic. While the syntax appears the same, keep in mind they behave differently (more on that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, an array is a container (or *collection*) of variables. Returning to the image above, think of the entire jar as an array. Each of the individual jars is an array name. This indicates the use of an array is different from that of a variable. Just like you use the jar of M&Ms to easily transport, sort, and organize pieces, an array provides the means to transport, sort, and organize variables in code. Programs that are thousands of lines long and contain multiple files have lots of variables. Arrays provide an easy solution for organizing and passing groups of variables around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays and lists are *indexed* (more on that below) while dictionaries (i.e., key-value pairs) are not. In Python, arrays possess the following characteristics:\n",
    "* Arrays are zero indexed: an array with *n* elements is indexed from 0 to *n*-1.\n",
    "* Arrays are declared just like variables. Array elements can be of any type, including an `array` type.\n",
    "  * The number of dimensions are set when an array variable is declared. \n",
    "  * The length of each dimension is established when the array instance is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first property of an array was mentioned above: \"Arrays are zero indexed: an array with *n* elements is indexed from 0 to *n*-1.\" This is foundational to arrays, so we will begin our discussion here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you lived with someone or known someone who is obsessive over organization? That person may own a label maker that allows them to print out labels. They place those sticker labels on plastic bins, drawers, shelves, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><center><img src = \"assets/m&m_labeled.png\"></center></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Labeling* is important for organization. In the image above, the two jars are labeled according to their color. If we want a piece that has some varying yellow tint, we simply pull the bin labeled \"yellow.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays have a similar system to \"label\" the \"bins\" contained inside of them. This system uses a simple numerical index starting at zero and ending at *n*-1, where *n* is the number of variables held by the array. So, if your array has 15 \"bins\" or variables, then the last bin will be labeled 14, or *n*-1 (i.e., 15 - 1 = 14).\n",
    "\n",
    "The bins in an array are referred to as *elements*. Thus, each element in an array has an assigned \"label\" or index value. The first element is assigned 0, the second element is assigned 1, with each subsequent element assigned the next index value. *This is important to remember!* \n",
    "\n",
    "> The index, or label, always starts at 0 in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why does indexing begin at 0 instead of 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the real reason is related to the programming language C and the expense of memory at the time of its development. Without going down a rabbit hole, it is \"cheaper\" to index at 0 than 1 (feel free to search online if you want to go deeper). Other programming languages, like C#, followed the pattern merely out of convention. Many early programming languages allowed the programmer to choose the indexing, so 1 was often a choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, conceptually, Python is actually two separate things that are packaged together: Python the programming language (i.e., syntax, code) and Python the implementation (i.e., what processes the syntax, the code). The original and default implementation is the programming language C. Sometimes, online, you may see people refer to Python as *CPython*. This is to differentiate it from *JPython*, or Python that is implemented with Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *CPython* is implemented using the C language. *CPython* and *JPython* use the same programming language (i.e., syntax) but then implement them in their own respective ways. Thus, because C language was the original implementation back in the early 90s, Python picked up a lot of its habits and behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Python (i.e., CPython) as the reference language. This is the main development platform. When you download Python from [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org), you are actually downloading CPython. Other flavors exist besides CPython and JPython: PyPy, IronPython, etc. You can read more about those alternative implementations at [https://www.python.org/download/alternatives/](https://www.python.org/download/alternatives/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, `counting != indexing`. Remember, indexing is a means of labeling an element within an array. When we count the number of elements in an array, we are enumerating how many elements exist. *That is not the purpose of indexing.* Again:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Indexing is a method of labeling the elements in an array, not for counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of indexing like the mile markers on a highway. When you cross into a new region or state, sometimes you will see a mile marker on the border labeled with 0. The image below shows the 0 mile marker for [U.S. Highway 1 (US 1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_1_in_Florida) which begins at the southern end of Florida in Key West.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><center><img src = \"assets/Florida-Highway-1-Mile-0.jpg\"></center></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents the origin. When starting at the origin, you are at 0, not 1. This is similar to a 2-dimensional graph with a horizontal axis *x*-axis and vertical axis *y*-axis. Both *x* and *y* begin at 0. Returning to the example, as you move away from mile marker 0, you are headed toward mile marker 1. You have not yet traversed any distance, so mile marker 0 is your origin. Once you have traveled 1 mile, then you reach mile marker 1. Yet, as you travel from 0 to 1, this is often referred to as the first mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an array, the first index value is 0 because it is the origin, the beginning of the array. As you move to the next element, you traverse 1 unit of the array, reaching index value 1. The index is referred to as the *ordinal* position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of this is like time on a clock. At the beginning of a movie, say 33 seconds into the movie, if I asked you the question, \"How far into the movie are we?\" what would you answer? Would you round up to 1 minute? If you look at a digital clock on a computer, it would show `00h:00m:33s`. In sports, the time between 0 seconds and 59 seconds is referred to as the first minute of play. The time between 60 seconds and 119 seconds, is referred to as the second minute of play. \n",
    "\n",
    "The minute marker between 0 and 59 seconds is not quite 1 minute. Yet, it is still referred to as the first minute of play. This is because one refers to indexing and the other refers to counting. Arrays in Python behave the same way. *Indexing starts at 0 while counting starts at 1.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declaration and Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The second property of an array is as follows:\n",
    "* Arrays are declared just like variables. Array elements can be of any type, including an `array` type.\n",
    "  * The number of dimensions are set when an array variable is declared.\n",
    "  * The length of each dimension is established when the array instance is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, initializing (i.e., declaring) an array follows a similar pattern to that of declaring a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`name`* = array('*`type`*', [`value1`, `value2`,...,`valueN`])\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to create an array of numbers, I would do it like so:"

    "This returns the number or count of elements in an array. Remember, the indexing and count are not the same. Thus, this returns the value of `4`, not `3`. We will return to this shortly, but `len()` will be important when we discuss iterating over collections with loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far you have learned about the collection arrays. As mentioned at the start of this module, Python provides various types of collections:\n",

    "* Lists\n",

    "1. Common list methods and properties\n",
    "1. Indexing\n",
    "1. Iterating over lists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose: List vs. Array\n",
    "\n",
    "For all intents and purposes, `lists` behave and operate like `arrays`. The most important distinction is a `list` can grow and shrink dynamically. Arrays are strongly typed. All elements in an array must be the same data type. At the creation of an array, you must declare its data type. If you create an array with 12 elements, all 12 must be the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, we can rely on `lists`. With a list object, we do not need to declare a data type. Lists are more Pythonic. Lists are an original data type of Python while arrays are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for initializing a list is comparable to an array. The basic syntax is as follows:\n",

The `for` loop is intended to work with collections such as `arrays`, `lists`, `dictionaries`, `sets`, and `tuples`.

    "* `initializer`: executed only one time before beginning the loop; e.g., `i = 0`.\n",
    "* `condition`: determines if the next iteration of the loop should be executed; must always be a boolean expression; e.g., `i < 2001`.\n",
    "* `iterator`: determines what happens after the successful completion of each loop; e.g., `i+=1` or `i = i + 1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, a `for` statement iterates over a collection. Unlike the `while` loop, *it does not evaluate a boolean expression*. Rather, you iterate sequentially over each element in the list. Thus, in Python, the `for` loop does not have an initializer, a conditional expression, or an iterator.\n",

    "## Dictionary: Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "You are already familiar with the collections `arrays` and `lists`. One of the important concepts related to these objects is they rely on an index to store, sort, and order the values they contain. You can think of an index like a primary key. In a database system, a table contains rows of data. Each row is differentiated from another by its primary key. This concept, using an `index`, presents a couple of problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are limited to the value of the index itself, which means the index is not a flexible key.\n",
    "2. The index starts at 0 and does not allow for other starting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `dictionary`, or `key-value pair` as it is sometimes referred to in programming, provides many of the same properties as `arrays` and `lists`. The key is a unique identifier while the value is some element you wish to store. Think of this like an array, except instead of using numbers as the index you define the index however you wish. The `key` is the index and the `value` is the element's value. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where it differs as a collection: it provides a link between a `key` and a `value`. You define the `key`. If you did not want to use a numerical `key`, you could use a `string`. For example, many organizations use social security number as a primary key. It is not a true number because 1) you cannot perform mathematical operations on it and 2) it contains hyphens `-`, so it is really just a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have an array containing ages of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student_age = [36, 22, 32, 64, 25, 56, 42, 33]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to retrieve the value for the 3rd employee, I would simply use the index to obtain the value like so:\n",

What advantages does a dictionary have compared to any of these other objects?\n",
